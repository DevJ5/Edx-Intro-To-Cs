Expression evaluates to something.
Statement does not.

Data Conversion.
- Implicit, this will not result in loss of data, because a long can hold the value.
int myInt = 2147483647;
long myLong = myInt;
- Explicit, this decimal will be lost, so we need to explicitly cast it.
double myDouble = 1234.6;
int myInt = (int)myDouble;
int myInt = Convert.ToInt32(myDouble);
